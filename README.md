# mo651Final

Final Project MO651 

Objective: Visual Target Following Based on Reinforcement Learning
           leader and follower are both pioneer robots
           
We used a DQN to the reinforcemnt learning using as input a set of four frames
As output, we used seven discrete actions: stop, forward, backward, right, left, right+forward, left+forward

The results of predicted actions for six different reward policies are presented in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=vH2Y3uDHTRo
